## completion3D: Stanford 3D Object Point Cloud Completion Benchmark & 
## TopNet: Structural Point Cloud Decoder

This repository contains source code for all methods used for the [Stanford 3D Object Point Cloud Completion Benchmark](https://completion3D.stanford.edu) and presented in the paper [TopNet: Structural Point Cloud Decoder, CVPR 2019](http://arxiv.org/abs/).


## Project Pages

The TopNet project page is available at [https://completion3D.stanford.edu/topnet](https://completion3D.stanford.edu/topnet).
The completion3D benchmark is available at [http://completion3D.stanford.edu](https://completion3D.stanford.edu/).

## Overview

The completion3D benchmark is a platform for evaluating state-of-the-art 3D Object Point Cloud Completion methods. This repository contains source code for various methods evaluated on the benchmark. Both **Tensorflow** and **Pytorch** are supported.

**3D Object Point Cloud Completion Results**: *A partial 3D point cloud is given as input and various methods used to generate a completed 3D point cloud*

## Benchmark submission instructions

To submit to the completion3d benchmark, set ```TRAIN=0``` and ```BENCHMARK=1``` in ```run.sh``` and run the script with parameters to evaluate. A ```submission.zip``` file will be generated by the script in the experiment output folder.
